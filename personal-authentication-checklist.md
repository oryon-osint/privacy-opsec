## Personal Authentication Checklist

1. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Generate complex passwords using phrases or a mix of characters. Recommended tools include [Use a Passphrase](https://www.useapassphrase.com/), [pwgen](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pwgen/), and [PasswordSafe](https://pwsafe.org/).

2. **Employ a Reliable Password Manager**: Store and manage passwords securely with a password manager. Consider using open-source options like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/), or [LessPass](https://lesspass.com/).

3. **Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhance security by adding a second layer of authentication. Use open-source 2FA apps such as [Google Authenticator](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator), [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/), or [andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP).

4. **Regularly Update Passwords**: Change passwords periodically for your accounts using features in password managers like Bitwarden, KeePassXC, or [Password Gorilla](https://github.com/zdia/gorilla).

5. **Avoid Password Reuse Across Platforms**: Use a unique password for each account managed by a password manager.

6. **Secure Backup Codes**: Store 2FA backup codes in a secure location. A tool like [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) can provide encrypted storage.

7. **Subscribe to Data Breach Alerts**: Stay informed with services like [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/), [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), or [BreachAlarm](https://breachalarm.com/).

8. **Practice Caution in Public Spaces**: Protect your password inputs in public areas.

9. **Avoid Saving Passwords in Web Browsers**: Instead, rely on dedicated password managers like Bitwarden, KeePassXC, or LessPass.

10. **Be Wary of Using Public or Shared Devices**: Minimize log-ins and erase traces using tools like [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/).

11. **Create Complex Security Answers**: Store non-obvious answers for security questions securely in your password manager.

12. **Use Long PINs for Devices**: Opt for longer PINs or alphanumeric passwords for better security.

13. **Prefer App-Based or Token-Based 2FA Over SMS**: Opt for more secure methods like [andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP), [Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/), or [OTP Authenticator](https://github.com/0xbb/otp-authenticator).

14. **Separate 2FA from Password Managers**: Use distinct apps for password management and 2FA.

15. **Exercise Caution with Biometric Authentication**: Combine biometrics with strong passwords for enhanced security.

16. **Regularly Check for Keyloggers**: Especially on public or shared devices.

17. **Consider a Hardware Security Key for 2FA**: Use hardware tokens like [Nitrokey](https://www.nitrokey.com/), [SoloKeys](https://solokeys.com/), or [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/) for added security.

18. **Use Offline Password Managers for Sensitive Data**: Employ offline password managers like KeePassXC or [PasswordSafe](https://pwsafe.org/) for highly sensitive information.

19. **Adopt Unique Usernames for Different Services**: Use different usernames to enhance privacy and security.

20. **Enable Account Lockout Policies**: Set up security settings to lock accounts after a number of incorrect login attempts.

21. **Monitor Account Activity Regularly**: Keep an eye on your accounts' security logs.

22. **Educate Yourself on Phishing Attacks**: Learn about common phishing tactics from resources like [Phishing.org](https://www.phishing.org/), [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/), or [Coursera Cybersecurity Courses](https://www.coursera.org/).

1. **Secure Your Primary Email Account**: Strengthen the security of your main email account with services like [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/), [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/), or [Mailfence](https://mailfence.com/).
2. **NIST Guidelines on Passwords**: Stay informed about the latest password security practices as recommended by [NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/).
